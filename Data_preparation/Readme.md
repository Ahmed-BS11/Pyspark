# Project Data Source

For this part of the project, I have used the Kaggle dataset named "new-york-city-airbnb-open-data."

[New York City Airbnb Open Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data/)

# Running Terminal Commands

To run a terminal command on Kaggle, Colab, or Jupyter, simply write it in a cell and add '!' at the beginning.

For example, to install PySpark, you can do as follows in a cell:

```python
!pip install pyspark
