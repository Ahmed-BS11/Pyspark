For this part of the project I have used the Kaggle dataset named "new-york-city-airbnb-open-data"

This is a link for the dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data/

to run a terminal command on kaggle, colabs or Jupiter just write it in a cell and add ! at the begging 

example to install Pyspark you can do as follows in a cell

!pip install pyspark
